Axios: We use Axios to fetch data from the NewsAPI.
useState & useEffect: React hooks are used to manage state and perform side effects (fetching data on component mount).
Loading/Error States: It handles loading and error states, displaying a loading message or error if necessary.
Mapping Articles: The fetched articles are displayed in a grid layout with the title, image, description, and a link to the full article.
News API
You will need to sign up at NewsAPI to get an API key and replace your_newsapi_key_here with your own.

Run your React app:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will fetch and display top headlines from the US. You can modify the API request to customize the news source or country.
